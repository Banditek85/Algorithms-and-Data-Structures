// Sliding window pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
// Depending on a certain condition, window increases or closes. Useful for keeping track of subset of data in array / string etc.

// Write a function maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and number n and calculates maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array

function maxSubarraySum(arr, n) {    
}
